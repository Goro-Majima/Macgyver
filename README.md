# Macgyver escape game

In this project, the goal is to create a 2D game where you (Macgyver) has to escape from a maze but a guardian is looking for you. In order to do so, he has to collect three items and put the guard asleep. 

If you collect less, you lose. You can restart the game as long as you want.
